# Netflix-Recommendation-Engine
🎬 Netflix Recommendation Engine This project builds a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques, analyzing user ratings and preferences to suggest relevant movies.

# What are Recommender Systems?
Recommender systems are algorithms designed to suggest relevant items to users. These systems are used in various domains such as e-commerce, streaming services, and social media. They enhance user experience by filtering vast amounts of information to deliver personalized content.

# 🔍 Project Overview
The recommendation engine processes Netflix user rating data to develop a personalized movie suggestion system. The dataset includes customer IDs, movie ratings, and additional metadata.

# 📊 Approaches Used
Three main recommendation techniques were implemented:

Content-Based Filtering – Recommends movies similar to those a user has rated highly.
Collaborative Filtering – Suggests movies based on the behavior of similar users.
Hybrid Approach – Combines both methods for improved accuracy.

# 📌 Key Steps

Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values.
Processed large-scale rating data.
Extracted unique customer and movie counts.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed user rating distributions.
Identified trends in popular movies.

Model Implementation:
Built a user-item matrix for collaborative filtering.
Used similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) for content-based recommendations.
Implemented Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization.

📈 Results
Content-Based Filtering: Provides personalized recommendations based on user history.
Collaborative Filtering: Captures user similarities but struggles with sparse data.
Hybrid Model: Enhances prediction accuracy and recommendation diversity.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Surprise Library (for collaborative filtering)
